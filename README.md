Welcome in the Project "My_Runner" of Epitech of Anthony Anicotte

To launch the game, just execute the "make" command at the root then ./my_runner with an argument:

   - The argument '-i' for a random & infinite map generation
   - A map file file (read the .legend for how to build it)
   - The argument '-h' to read the help

The goal is to finish the map if one is sent to the program, or to get the best score in infinite mode.

/!\ The CSFML library is required /!\
